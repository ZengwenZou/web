 <h2>Intro to Chrismas</h2>
<p>Christmas is celebrated on December 25 both as a sacred religious holiday and a worldwide cultural event. Christians celebrate Christmas day as the anniversary of Jesus, whose teachings are the basis of their religion.
People who arenâ€™t Christians usually celebrate Christmas because everyone else is doing it and it is a great time to spend time with your close family, relatives, and friends. With it being at the end of the year, people can share what they did the past year and all round have a great time.</p>
